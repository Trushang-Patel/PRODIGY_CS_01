# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Text Encryption and Decryption

This is a simple Python program that implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm. It allows users to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a text message using a specified shift value.

## ✨ Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores punctuation, numbers, and spaces (they are preserved)
- User-friendly command-line interface

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- ...
- `Z` becomes `C` (wraps around)

Decryption works by shifting in the opposite direction.
